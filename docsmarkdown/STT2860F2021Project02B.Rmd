### Background of the Data

The datasets were downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). You can find the links to their descriptions in the `docsreference` folder.

### Create Analysis Datasets

Complete and run the two scripts found in the `docscripts` folder. Your processed datasets all should be written into the `dataprocessed` folder. Load the resulting `.Rdata` file above under the **Setup** header and use `glimpse()` to explore the structure of each dataset.

#### Dataset #1

The `dplus` dataset contains a variable that gives information about the `rating` for each program offering. Convert the variable into a factor that puts the ratings in (roughly) ascending order of age restriction/audience: `TV-Y`, `TV-Y7`, `TV-Y7-FV`, `TV-G`, `G`, `TV-PG`, `PG`, `PG-13`, `TV-14`. If the `date_added` variable is not already in date format, convert it.  

```{r factorratings}
dplus$rating <- factor(dplus$rating, levels = c("TV-Y", "TV-Y7", "TV-Y7-FV", "TV-G", "G", "TV-PG", "PG", "PG-13", "TV-14"))
```

#### Dataset #2

In the `strmtv` dataset, create a new variable that tells you the total number of streaming services that offer each included program.

```{r numberofsvcs}
colnames(strmtv) <- c("ID", "Title", "Year", "Age", "IMDb", "Rotten_Tomatoes", "Netflix", "Hulu", "Prime_Video", "Disney_Plus")
head(strmtv)
strmtv1 <- strmtv %>%
  mutate(Services = Netflix + Hulu + Prime_Video + Disney_Plus)
strmtv1
```

### Part 1: Violin Plot

Create a violin plot of `release_year` (x-axis) grouped by `type` of program (y-axis) for programs on Disney+. Fill with a color of your choice. Add a boxplot inside the violin plot, as you did in one of the DataCamp exercises. Re-scale the x-axis so that tick marks appear at whole-decade intervals (e.g., 1980, 1990, 2000). Add an appropriate title and axis labels. Use other formatting as you choose to enhance effectiveness/appearance.

```{r}
ggplot(dplus, aes(release_year, type)) +
  geom_violin(fill = "lightpink") +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = 0, width = 0.2) +
  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 10) +
  xlab("Year Released") + 
  ylab("Type of Program") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Release Years for Movies and TV Shows on Disney+") + 
theme_linedraw()

```

### Part 2: Waffle Plot

```{r galtonscatterplot, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "../images/shrekdonkey.gif")
```

Create a waffle plot to show the distribution of program `type` on Disney+. 

* Give the plot the title "Streaming Content on Disney+". 
* Change the colors of the squares to something other than the defaults.
* Use an x-axis label to indicate roughly how many programs each square represents.

Hint: You can use `count()` to find out how many of each `type` of program there is, then use `prop.table(n)` in a mutate statement (along with some other math) to get percentages. Other methods are also possible.

```{r}
type_count <- count(dplus, type) 

count <- type_count %>%
  mutate(percent = round(n/sum(n)*100))
count

sum_counts <- count$percent

names(sum_counts) <- type_count$type


waffle(sum_counts, legend_pos = "bottom", colors = c("#1B9E77", "#E7298A")) +
  xlab("Each Square Represents Approximatelty 13.68 Programs") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Program Type on Disney+")
```

### Part 3: Bar Plot

Create a horizontal barplot to show the frequencies of the various `rating` categories for programs on Disney+ (i.e., use `y =` rather than `x =` for the variable you are plotting). You will need to remove a couple 'NA' values first. Use faceting by `type` so that you have side-by-side plots for the different program types. Add an appropriate title and axis labels, as well as other formatting of your choice to enhance effectiveness/appearance.

```{r}
dplus1 <- dplus %>%
  filter(!is.na(rating))
dplus1
ggplot(dplus1, aes(y= rating)) + 
  geom_bar(fill = "darkorchid1") +
  facet_wrap(~type) + 
  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 10) +
  ylab("Rating") +
  xlab("Number of Movies or TV Shows Per Rating") + 
  labs(title = "Frequencies of Various Ratings for Programs on Disney+") +
  theme_linedraw()
```

### Part 4: Another Plot

Use one of the sets that contains data about the TV shows available on various streaming services to compare the quantity of Disney's TV show offerings to the quantity of offerings on other streaming services. Use a plot of your choice to enhance the effectiveness/appearance of the plot.

```{r}
ggplot(strmtv_long, aes(y = Service)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "coral1") +
  ylab("Streaming Service") + 
  xlab("Number of TV Shows Available Per Network") + 
  scale_x_continuous(n.breaks = 10) +
  labs(title = "Comparison of Number of TV Shows Available Per Network") +
  theme_linedraw()
```



## Questions

**Question 1:** Based on your plots, make five informational statements or comparisons regarding the Disney+ streaming service.

**ANSWER**

1) Disney+ primarily has movies available to stream, with only about 28% of their content being tv shows.

2) The oldest tv show available on Disney+ was released in 1955, with the oldest movie being released before 1930.

3) Disney+ has approximately the same number of tv shows and movies available that are rated TV-14.

4) The majority of tv shows on Disney+ are from 2010 and later, with a higher percentage of total tv shows being new releases compared to movies.

5) While Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime each have a similar number of tv shows available, Disney+ has less than one fourth of the amount of tv shows that any of those services.

**Question 2:** What other data would you like to have, or which existing variables would you like to see transformed, if you were going to do further explorations or visualizations? Give at least two examples.

**ANSWER**

If I were to do further explorations or visualizations, I would like to see the total amount of views that each tv show has received between the services that it is offered on. This will allow us to compare the popularity of different shows between services and compare the total amount of views on each service, and the average amount of views a service has per show.
I would also like to see the total number of episodes of each show within the tv shows data set. Seeing the total number of episodes that each service has will give additional details to the total amount of content available on the service.
